A program that creates a fibonacci sequence by taking the number of elements from the user.

What is Fibonacci Sequence?

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2

Case

The Fibonacci sequence with 9 elements is as follows:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

0 + 1 = 1

0 + 1 = 2

1 + 2 = 3

2 + 3 = 5

3 + 5 = 8

5 + 8 = 13

13 + 8 = 21

21 + 8 = 34
