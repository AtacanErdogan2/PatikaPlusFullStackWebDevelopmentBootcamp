***Transpose of a Matrix***

The transpose of a matrix is one of the most common methods used for matrix transformation in matrix concepts across
linear algebra. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing the rows into columns and columns into rows for a
given matrix. It is especially useful in applications where inverse and adjoint of matrices are to be obtained.

***What is the Transpose of a Matrix?***

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing its rows into columns (or equivalently, its columns into rows). A
rectangular array of numbers or functions that are arranged in the form of rows and columns is called a matrix. This
array of numbers are called either entries or elements of a matrix.

**_Case_**

***Matrix*** :

[2, 3, 4]   
[5, 6, 4]

***Transpose*** :

[2, 5]  
[3, 6]   
[4, 4]    

***Matrix*** :

[1, 2, 3]   
[4, 5, 6]

***Transpose*** :

[1, 4]    
[2, 5]   
[3, 6]
